Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm a cybersecurity analyst.
I am a college student.
I enjoy learning about cybersecurity topics such as threat hunting, analysis, and pen-testing.
I like to read cybersecurity news articles, CVE databases like NVD, watch youtube videos on new threats and fundamental threats, and playing HTB.
I've realized that the most important thing in this field is hands-on experience, research, and community.
I am currently learning how to create APIs and doing cloud security research.

As I dive deep into this field, I realize there's an entire new world down here. There are so many things I do not know yet - so many different ways to exploit, to configure, to program, the frameworks involved, certs to acquire, how defense ties in with offense, how networking, software, and IT come together, it is all very fascinating. I think I found my resting place, where I can learn as much as I want without running out or without having a community that's built up enough to learn anything.
